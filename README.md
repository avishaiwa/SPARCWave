####################################
This software package uses both Python and R. All code can and should be run only via Python.

R is used for simulations, wavelet transforms, and the sparcl library (Witten & Tibshirani 2010).
Python is used for CVXPY, and as a wrapper for R code.


In addition, Matlab is used for computing the scattering transform on signal. 


Required Python libraries: CVXPY, rpy2, sklearn, joblib, numpy, pylab (and dependencies). 

http://cvxpy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial/intro/
http://rpy.sourceforge.net/
http://scikit-learn.org/stable/
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/joblib


Required R libraries: sparcl, wmtsa (and dependencies). 
These libraries need to be in the global environment for rpy2 to load them. A simple way to do so is to put
the folders containing these libraries in [R-PATH]/library. For example: "C:\Program Files\R\R-3.2.1\library" 

Required Matlab libraries: the scatnent library
